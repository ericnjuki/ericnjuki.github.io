Previously, I've worked on cross-platform native apps, web apps, APIs. I've work with a wide variety of technologies though I usually prefer to match the tools to the task at hand. Oftentimes I just use whatever interests me at the time. Right now, I'm working with Next.js (full stack) and Mongo (serverless). Check out my skills and projects below.",

      "description": "Bismillah Hardware was a small hardware store located in Thika that sells hardware supplies. After years of operation, the store's owner was overwhelmed by the amount of clerical work needed to maintain financial records. He simply wanted to focus on his job which was selling supplies.\nHe aptly deduced that he needed a digital solution and I agreed. I had no idea what a point-of-sale system was when I eagerly set out to find a solution to this problem. In fact, I didn't find out what it was until halfway through the project. By which point I realized that not only was there a better way to design what I was building, but there were already free and open source implementations of them, not to mention plenty of commercial solutions available.\nBeing my first project however, I decided to plough through it till the end and called it a 'simple point-of-sale system'. This ended up being its most defining feature: it was simple, fast and most importantly, cheap to use since it ran directly from a local server and only occasionally made back ups to the cloud.\nThe client was pleased with the solution and so was I. The store has since closed but I was grateful for my first opportunity to create an app that provided real world value.",
