While they accomplished much since they started, they felt it was time put their business online and expand their customer base./n/nFor this, they had a clear design and content strategy which made the task much easier./n/nIn fact the only significant challenge was the fact that I'd never worked with Wordpress at all, a challenge quickly surmounted by the sheer amount of resources and help available for the most popular CMS engine./n/nWhat resulted was a website PHSS were very satisfied with borne through a process I had a lot fun learning and growing with.",
