        "description": "Founded in 1954, Burger King is the second largest fast food hamburger chain in the world. When Burger King came to Kenya, they needed an online presence to match their status and start serving new customers their long-awaited burgers.\nI was part of the team granted the tasty opportunity to make this happen. Personally, I had my qualms about job, something something not qualified something something. But the onboarding process did a great job of quelling my worries: Burger King already had an established design system and we had a designer in the team who would guide the whole design process. I simply needed to do what I did best and that was write code. Awesome :)\nThe next challenge that presented itself was, with dozens of local Burger King websites using one unified system, it was difficult to create something that really stood out. However, eventually, after making some bold design decisions, we finally settled on something that both the team and the client were happy with.\nNow Kenya has joined the fray of Burger King restaurant locations serving more than 11 million guests every day around the world.",

        "description": "Bismillah Hardware was a small hardware store located in Thika that sells hardware supplies. After years of operation, the store's owner was overwhelmed by the amount of clerical work needed to maintain financial records. He simply wanted to focus on his job which was selling supplies.\nHe aptly deduced that he needed a digital solution and I agreed. I had no idea what a point-of-sale system was when I eagerly set out to find a solution to this problem. In fact, I didn't find out what it was until halfway through the project. By which point I realized that not only was there a better way to design what I was building, but there were already free and open source implementations of them, not to mention plenty of commercial solutions available.\nBeing my first project however, I decided to plough through it till the end and called it a 'simple point-of-sale system'. This ended up being its most defining feature: it was simple, fast and most importantly, cheap to use since it ran directly from a local server and only occasionally made back ups to the cloud.\nThe client was pleased with the solution and so was I. The store has since closed but I was grateful for my first opportunity to create an app that provided real world value.",

While they accomplished much since they started, they felt it was time put their business online and expand their customer base.\nFor this, they had a clear design and content strategy which made the task much easier.\nIn fact the only significant challenge was the fact that I'd never worked with Wordpress at all, a challenge quickly surmounted by the sheer amount of resources and help available for the most popular CMS engine.\nWhat resulted was a website PHSS were very satisfied with borne through a process I had a lot fun learning and growing with.",
